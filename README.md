First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

`$ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.4.0"`

Now run it against this repo:

`$ cookiecutter https://github.com/murarisumit/cookiecutter-aws-lambda`

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, and you'll have aws lambda function file structure created.
